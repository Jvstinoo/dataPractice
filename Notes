How are generic types used?

	For non-static methods:
		Class has to include it will use generic type
			public class keepEven<E>{
				public int keepEven(SinglyLinkedList<E> ls);
				
	For static methods:
		Class cannot include but method does.
			public class keepEven{
				public stating <E> int keepEven(SinglyLinkedList<E> ls);

Stacks:
	Can be implemented using LinkedLists and Arraylists.
		ArrayList (ListStack): size()-1 would represent the top of the stack since no shifting would be 				      required.
		LinkedList (LinkedStack): position 0 would represent the top of the stack since adding at head 						 of Linked List is constant.
					  pop(){
						if(isEmpty()) // Can also use head == null
							throw new NoSuchElementException();
						Node<E> oldTop = head;
						E out = oldTop.getElement();
						top = head.getNext();
						oldTop.clear();
						size--;
						return out;
