How are generic types used?

	For non-static methods:
		Class has to include it will use generic type
			public class keepEven<E>{
				public int keepEven(SinglyLinkedList<E> ls);
				
	For static methods:
		Class cannot include but method does.
			public class keepEven{
				public stating <E> int keepEven(SinglyLinkedList<E> ls);
